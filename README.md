# CPP-Scratch-Engine
The following is the source code for an engine I created utilizing SDL that I call "DAS" which I have iterated over several times. Although I eventually opted to focus my game development freetime on using pre-existing engines in order to maximize actual game development time this project remains an excellent showcase of my experience level with C++.

The src folder contains the code for the engine and the top level source files contain the game specific code.
